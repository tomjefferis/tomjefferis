# Hi, I'm Tom Jefferis

Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the University of Birmingham. My research focuses on time series analysis and signal processing methods for EEG data, developing robust algorithms for extracting signal from noisy neural recordings.

## Technologies & Tools

**Languages:** Python, MATLAB, SQL, Web, Java, C++, C#  
**Analysis:** FieldTrip, SPM, EEGLab, NumPy/SciPy, pandas, scikit-learn, pytorch  
**Methods:** Dynamic Time Warping, statistical modelling, permutation testing, cluster-based correction, resampling techniques, machine learning

## Current Research

Developing noise-robust methods for ERP latency estimation, with a focus on Dynamic Time Warping as an alternative to traditional peak-detection approaches. Also investigating resampling techniques (jackknife/bootstrap) versus direct estimation for statistical inference on neural time series. 

## Projects

**[Visual Acuity RSVP - Repo coming soon]**  
RSVP paradigm for visual acuity assessment with EEG integration. ML pipeline using random forest and ensemble models for classification, with feature engineering from neural time series data.

**[Dynamic Time Warping for EEG Latency](https://github.com/tomjefferis/dynamic-time-warping-eeg)**  
DTW-based latency measures with simulation benchmarking against traditional methods. Includes mass-univariate analysis pipeline for whole-volume latency contrasts.

**[Pattern Glare Analysis](https://github.com/tomjefferis/FieldTrip-Pattern-Glare)**  
Analysis pipeline for 128-channel EEG investigating cortical hyperexcitation to visual stimuli. Covers the first two years of my PhD research on sensitisation and habituation effects.
