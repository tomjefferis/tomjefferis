# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Tom Jefferis, a passionate PhD researcher and software engineer from the UK. Welcome to my GitHub profile! ðŸš€

## ðŸ”§ Technologies & Tools

- **Languages:** MATLAB, Python, Dart, C#, C, C++, and web languages
- **Frameworks:** Vue, React, Flutter, Fieldtrip, EEGLab
- **Tools:** Neuroscience toolboxes in MATLAB for working with ERP data

## ðŸŒ± Currently Learning

I am currently focused on improving my skills in Vue and DevOps.

## ðŸ“š Currently Studying

I'm diving deep into computational neuroscience methods for ERP latency analysis and cortical hyperexcitation to adverse visual stimuli.

## ðŸš€ Projects

Here are some projects that I'm working on:

1. [Pattern Glare Analysis](https://github.com/tomjefferis/FieldTrip-Pattern-Glare): This project encompasses the first 2 years of my PhD research. It focuses on analysis of the presentation of the pattern-glare stimuli recorded with 128 channel EEG.
2. [Detecting EEG latency measures using DTW](https://github.com/tomjefferis/dynamic-time-warping-eeg): This project focuses on detecting latency differences in ERP signals using Dynamic time warping.

Feel free to explore them and provide feedback!
